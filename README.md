# Weather Forecast Project
## Overview
**This project is a Python-based weather forecast application that retrieves and displays current weather conditions and forecasts for a given location. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and provides a user-friendly interface to display the information.**

## Features
1. Retrieves current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description
2. Displays 5-day weather forecast with high and low temperatures, weather description, and icons
3. Supports multiple locations, allowing users to switch between different cities
4. Provides a simple and intuitive user interface using a command-line interface (CLI)
## Requirements
1. Python 3.8 or later
2. OpenWeatherMap API key (free registration required)
3. *'requests'* library for making API calls

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Muskaan-Aggarwal/weather-forecast.git
2. Install the required libraries: pip install requests json
3. Create a file named api_key.txt in the project root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key
4. Run the application: python weather_forecast.py
## Usage
1. Run the application: python weather_forecast.py
2. Enter a location (city name or zip code) when prompted
